## Introduction

Germline mutation rates reflect the complex interplay between DNA proofreading and repair pathways, exogenous sources of DNA damage, and life-history traits. 
For example, parental age is an important determinant of mutation rate variability; in many mammalian species, the number of germline *de novo* mutations observed in offspring increases as a function of paternal and maternal age [@PMID:28959963;@PMID:31549960;@PMID:35771663;@PMID:32804933;@PMID:31492841].
Rates of germline mutation accumulation are also variable across human families [@PMID:26656846;@PMID:31549960], likely due to either genetic variation or differences in environmental exposures.
Although numerous protein-coding genes contribute to the maintenance of genome integrity, genetic variants that increase germline mutation rates, known as *mutator alleles*, have proven difficult to discover in mammals.

The dearth of observed germline mutators in mammalian genomes is not necessarily surprising, since alleles that lead to elevated germline mutation rates would likely have deleterious consequences and be purged by negative selection [@PMID:27739533].
Moreover, germline mutation rates are relatively low, and direct mutation rate measurements require whole-genome sequencing data from both parents and their offspring.
As a result, large-scale association studies &mdash; which have been used to map the contributions of common genetic variants to many complex traits &mdash; are not currently well-powered to investigate the polygenic architecture of germline mutation rates.  

Despite these challenges, less traditional strategies have been used to identify a small number of mutator alleles in both humans and mice. 
By focusing on families with rare genetic diseases, a recent study identified two mutator alleles that lead to significantly elevated rates of *de novo* germline mutation in human genomes [@PMID:35545669]. 
Another group discovered mutator phenotypes in the sperm and somatic tissues of adults who possess cancer-predisposing inherited mutations in the POLE/POLD1 exonucleases [@PMID:34594041].
Candidate mutator loci were also discovered by identifying human haplotypes with excess counts of derived alleles in the Thousand Genomes Project, though these loci could not be replicated using *de novo* germline mutation data from pedigrees [@PMID:28095480].

In mice, a germline mutator allele was recently discovered by sequencing a large family of inbred mice.
Commonly known as the <u>B</u>X<u>D</u>s [@PMID:33472028], these recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were derived from either F2 or advanced intercrosses of C57<u>B</u>L/6J and <u>D</u>BA/2J, two laboratory strains that exhibit significant differences in their germline mutation spectra [@PMID:30753674]. 
The BXDs were maintained via brother-sister mating for up to 180 generations, and each BXD therefore accumulated hundreds or thousands of germline mutations on a nearly-homozygous linear mosaic of parental <u>B</u> and <u>D</u> haplotypes. 
Due to their husbandry in a controlled laboratory setting, the BXDs were largely free from confounding by environmental heterogeneity, and the effects of selection on *de novo* mutations were attenuated by strict inbreeding [@doi:10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.39.110707.173437]. 

In this previous study, whole-genome sequencing data from the BXD family were used to map a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for the C>A mutation rate [@PMID:35545679].
Germline C>A mutation rates were nearly 50% higher in mice with *D* haplotypes at the QTL, likely due to genetic variation in the DNA glycosylase *Mutyh* that reduced the efficacy of oxidative DNA damage repair.
Importantly, the QTL was undetectable in a genome-wide scan for variation in overall germline mutation rates, which were only modestly higher in BXDs with *D* alleles, demonstrating the utility of mutation spectrum analysis for mutator allele discovery.
Close examination of the mutation spectrum is likely to be broadly useful for detecting mutator alleles, as genes involved in DNA proofreading and repair often recognize particular sequence motifs or excise specific types of DNA lesions [@PMID:32619789].
Mutation spectra are usually defined in terms of $k$-mer nucleotide context; the 1-mer mutation spectrum, for example, consists of 6 mutation types after collapsing by strand complement (C>T, C>A, C>G, A>T, A>C, A>G), while the 3-mer mutation spectrum contains 96 (each of the 1-mer mutations partitioned by trinucleotide context).

Although mutation spectrum analysis can enable the discovery of mutator alleles that affect the rates of specific mutation types, early implementations of this strategy have suffered from a few drawbacks. 
For example, performing association tests on the rates or fractions of every $k$-mer mutation type can quickly incur a substantial multiple testing burden.
Since germline mutation rates are generally quite low, estimates of $k$-mer mutation type frequencies from individual samples may also be noisy and imprecise.
We were therefore motivated to develop a statistical method that could overcome the sparsity of *de novo* mutation spectra, eliminate the need to test each $k$-mer mutation type separately, and enable sensitive detection of alleles that influence the germline mutation spectrum.

Here, we present a new mutation spectrum association test, called "inter-haplotype distance," which minimizes multiple testing burdens and mitigates the challenges of sparsity in *de novo* mutation datasets. 
We leverage this method to re-analyze germline mutation data from the BXD family and find compelling evidence of a second mutator allele that was undetectable using previous approaches. 
The new allele appears to interact epistatically with the mutator that was previously discovered in the BXDs, further augmenting the C>A germline mutation rate in a subset of mice. 
Our observation of epistasis suggests that mild DNA repair deficiencies may compound one another, as mutator alleles chip away at the redundant systems that collectively maintain germline integrity.
