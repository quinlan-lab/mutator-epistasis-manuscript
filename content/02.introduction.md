## Introduction

The germline mutation rate is a fundamental parameter in population genetics, and reflects the complex interplay between DNA replication and repair pathways, exogenous sources of DNA damage, and life-history traits. 
*Mutator alleles* may explain some of the within- and between-species variation in germline mutation rates [@PMID:32619789], but have proven challenging to identify in mammalian genomes. 

<!--In microorganisms like *Escherichia coli*, mutator alleles have emerged during experimental evolution [@PMID:], and human cancer genomes often harbor deleterious mutator alleles as well [@PMID:27197248].-->

Germline mutator alleles are difficult to detect for a number of reasons, including the fidelity of germline genome replication and the effects of selection on mutators. 
On average, humans are born with 70 to 100 single-nucleotide *de novo* germline mutations per diploid genome [@PMID:28959963;@PMID:31549960]; in mice, that number is closer to 20 or 30 [@PMID:31492841]. 
Due to the low baseline germline mutation rate in many mammals, it can be challenging to ascertain sequencing data from enough haplotypes to reliably detect those with significantly elevated *de novo* mutation counts. 
Moreover, in a population of sufficiently large $N_e$ (effective population size), large-effect mutator alleles will likely be purged by negative selection. 
The estimated selection coefficient on a mutator allele is approximately $2s \Delta U$ [@PMID:27739533], where $s$ is the mean selective coefficient on a new deleterious mutation and $\Delta U$ is the excess number of deleterious mutations caused by the mutator allele; the product of $s$ and $\Delta U$ is multiplied by $2$ to account for the average number of generations for which mutator is linked to the excess mutations it causes. 

Compared to haplotypes that harbor wild-type alleles at a particular locus, those with mutator alleles will likely carry an excess of total germline mutations. 
Indeed, candidate germline mutator loci have been discovered in human genomes by identifying haplotypes with significantly more derived alleles than the population mean [@PMID:28095480]. 
However, protein-coding genes involved in DNA replication and repair often recognize particular sequence motifs or excise lesions at specific nucleotides [@PMID:32619789], so we might also expect the *spectrum* of de novo mutations to differ between genomes that carry either a mutator or wild-type allele at a given locus.
Mutation spectra are usually defined in terms of $k$-mer nucleotide context [@PMID:32619789]; the 1-mer mutation spectrum, for example, consists of 6 mutation types after collapsing by strand complement (C>T, C>A, C>G, A>T, A>C, A>G), while the 3-mer mutation spectrum contains 96 (each of the 1-mer mutations partitioned by trinucleotide context).

A straightforward approach to discover alleles that affect elements of the mutation spectrum might involve comparing the rates of individual $k$-mer mutation types between groups of haplotypes at a set of candidate loci (e.g., via quantitative trait locus mapping).
However, this approach can quickly incur a substantial multiple testing burden, and since germline mutation rates are generally quite low, estimates of $k$-mer mutation type frequencies on each haplotype may be noisy and imprecise.
We were therefore motivated to develop a statistical method that could overcome the sparsity of *de novo* mutation spectra, eliminate the need to test each $k$-mer mutation type separately, and enable sensitive detection of alleles that influence the germline mutation spectrum.

To maximize our power to detect germline mutator alleles, we analyzed whole-genome sequencing data derived from a large collection of recombinant inbred lines (RILs).
Commonly known as the <u>B</u>X<u>D</u>s [@PMID:33472028], these RILs were derived from either F2 or advanced intercrosses of C57<u>B</u>L/6J and <u>D</u>BA/2J, two laboratory strains that exhibit significant differences in their germline mutation spectra [@PMID:30753674]. 
Since the BXD RILs were maintained via brother-sister mating for up to 180 generations and housed in a controlled laboratory environment, they represent an ideal population for mutator allele discovery. 
Each line accumulated hundreds or thousands of germline mutations on a nearly-homozygous linear mosaic of parental <u>B</u> and <u>D</u> haplotypes, while the effects of negative selection on new and standing variation were attenuated by strict inbreeding [@doi:10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.39.110707.173437]. 

In a previous study, we used quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping to identify a locus on chromosome 4 that was strongly associated with the C>A germline mutation rate in the BXDs [@PMID:35545679]. 
The QTL overlapped *Mutyh*, which encodes a protein that normally prevents C>A mutations by repairing oxidative DNA damage [@PMID:17581577], and we hypothesized that missense mutations in *Mutyh* were responsible for a 50% increase in the C>A mutation rate between BXDs with either parental haplotype at the QTL [@PMID:35545679].
Using QTL mapping, however, we lacked power to detect more subtle germline mutation rate modifiers in the BXDs.

Here, we demonstrate the power of our new approach to detect candidate mutator alleles, use it to re-identify the mutator near *Mutyh*, and discover compelling evidence of epistasis between two germline mutator alleles that augment the C>A germline mutation rate in the BXD RILs.
