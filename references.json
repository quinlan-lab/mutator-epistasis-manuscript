The clinical significance of these mutational signatures is still largely unknown. In neuroblastoma, we showed that high levels of cytosine &gt; adenine (C &gt; A) substitutions are associated with poor survival. We identified that these high levels of C &gt; A substitutions result from defects in 8-oxo-guanine repair, specifically from copy number loss of the DNA glycosylases\n            <jats:italic>MUTYH</jats:italic>\n            and\n            <jats:italic>OGG1</jats:italic>\n            . The high frequency of C &gt; A substitutions in neuroblastoma contributes to the increased adaptive capacity of these tumors. Thereby, we link basic molecular genetic mutation patterns to clinically significant tumor evolution processes.\n          </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>Diverse inbred mouse strains are among the foremost models for biomedical research, yet genome characterization of many strains has been fundamentally lacking in comparison to human genomics research. In particular, the discovery and cataloging of structural variants is incomplete, limiting the discovery of potentially causative alleles for phenotypic variation across individuals. Here, we utilized long-read sequencing to resolve genome-wide structural variants (SVs, variants â‰¥ 50 bp) in 20 genetically distinct inbred mice. We report 413,758 site-specific SVs that affect 13% (356 Mbp) of the current mouse reference assembly, including 510 previously unannotated variants which alter coding sequences. We find that 39% of SVs are attributed to transposable element (TE) variation accounting for 75% of bases altered by SV. We then utilized this callset to investigate the impact of TE heterogeneity on mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), and find multiple TE classes that influence chromatin accessibility across loci. We also identify strain-specific transcription start sites originating in polymorphic TEs that modify gene expression. Our work provides the first long-read based analysis of mouse SVs and illustrates that previously unresolved TEs underlie epigenetic and transcriptome differences in mESCs.</jats:p>",

Phenotypic assays of MA lines inform us about the nature of new mutational variation for quantitative traits and provide estimates of the genomic rate and the distribution of effects of new mutations. Parameter estimates compared for a range of species suggest that the genomic mutation rate varies by several orders of magnitude and that the distribution of effects tends to be dominated by large-effect mutations. Some experiments suggest synergistic interactions between the effects of spontaneous deleterious mutations, whereas others do not. There is little reliable information on the distribution of dominance effects of new mutations. Most evidence does not suggest strong dependency of the effects of new mutations on the environment. Information from phenotypic assays has recently been augmented by direct molecular estimates of the mutation rate. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have suggested that the human germline mutation rate and spectrum evolve rapidly. Variation in generation time has been linked to these changes, though its contribution remains unclear. We develop a framework to characterize temporal changes in polymorphisms within and between populations, while controlling for the effects of natural selection and biased gene conversion. Application to the 1000 Genomes Project dataset reveals multiple independent changes that arose after the split of continental groups, including a previously reported, transient elevation in TCC>TTC mutations in Europeans and novel signals of divergence in C>G and T>A mutation rates among population samples. We also find a significant difference between groups sampled in and outside of Africa, in old T>C polymorphisms that predate the out-of-Africa migration. This surprising signal is driven by TpG>CpG mutations, and stems in part from mis-polarized CpG transitions, which are more likely to undergo recurrent mutations. Finally, by relating the mutation spectrum of polymorphisms to parental age effects on de novo mutations, we show that plausible changes in the generation time cannot explain the patterns observed for different mutation types jointly. Thus, other factors--genetic modifiers or environmental exposures--must have had a non-negligible impact on the human mutation landscape.",

    "abstract": "De novo mutations (DNMs) in the germline have long been identified as a key element in the causes of developmental and other genetic disorders. Previous attempts to investigate genetic factors affecting DNMs have suffered from a lack of statistical power, due to the difficulty of obtaining a sufficient number of parent-offspring trios. Thus, the rare disease cohort of the UKâ€™s 100k Genomes Project (100kGP), comprising more than 10,000 trios, represents an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the genetics of germline mutation. Here we estimate SNP heritability of DNM count in offspring, as a measure of the relative contribution of genetic factors to the variance of the trait, in a PCA-selected subset of the 100kGP cohort. We estimate separate SNP heritabilities for paternally and maternally transmitted mutations (based on parentally phased DNMs in offspring), computed using parental genetic variants at a range of minimum frequencies and a variety of methodologies. We estimate a heritability of 10-20% for paternal DNMs; by contrast, for maternal DNMs we find no significant evidence for non-zero heritability. We investigated the partitioning of heritability among genes with different expression profiles in different tissue or cell states, and found a relative heritability enrichment for genes expressed in gonadal tissues, particularly testis. Among germ cells in adult testes we observed relative enrichment of heritability in genes associated with the (undifferentiated) spermatogonial stem cell state.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic, interpreted languages, like Python, are attractive for domain-experts and scientists experimenting with new ideas. However, the performance of the interpreter is often a barrier when scaling to larger data sets. This paper presents a just-in-time compiler for Python that focuses in scientific and array-oriented computing. Starting with the simple syntax of Python, Numba compiles a subset of the language into efficient machine code that is comparable in performance to a traditional compiled language. In addition, we share our experience in building a JIT compiler using LLVM[1].",

    "abstract": "Data analysis often entails a multitude of heterogeneous steps, from the application of various command line tools to the usage of scripting languages like R or Python for the generation of plots and tables. It is widely recognized that data analyses should ideally be conducted in a reproducible way.&nbsp;Reproducibility enables technical validation and regeneration of results on the original or even new data. However, reproducibility alone is by no means sufficient to deliver an analysis that is of lasting impact (i.e., sustainable) for the field, or even just one research group. We postulate that it is equally important to ensure adaptability and transparency. The former describes the ability to modify the analysis to answer extended or slightly different research questions. The latter describes the ability to understand the analysis in order to judge whether it is not only technically, but methodologically valid. Here, we analyze the properties needed for a data analysis to become reproducible, adaptable, and transparent. We show how the popular workflow management system Snakemake can be used to guarantee this, and how it enables an ergonomic, combined, unified representation of all steps involved in data analysis, ranging from raw data processing, to quality control and fine-grained, interactive exploration and plotting of final results.",

    "abstract": "The characterization of mutational processes that generate sequence diversity in the human genome is of paramount importance both to medical genetics and to evolutionary studies. To understand how the age and sex of transmitting parents affect de novo mutations, here we sequence 1,548 Icelanders, their parents, and, for a subset of 225, at least one child, to 35Ã— genome-wide coverage. We find 108,778 de novo mutations, both single nucleotide polymorphisms and indels, and determine the parent of origin of 42,961. The number of de novo mutations from mothers increases by 0.37 per year of age (95% CI 0.32-0.43), a quarter of the 1.51 per year from fathers (95% CI 1.45-1.57). The number of clustered mutations increases faster with the mother's age than with the father's, and the genomic span of maternal de novo mutation clusters is greater than that of paternal ones. The types of de novo mutation from mothers change substantially with age, with a 0.26% (95% CI 0.19-0.33%) decrease in cytosine-phosphate-guanine to thymine-phosphate-guanine (CpG>TpG) de novo mutations and a 0.33% (95% CI 0.28-0.38%) increase in C>G de novo mutations per year, respectively. Remarkably, these age-related changes are not distributed uniformly across the genome. A striking example is a 20 megabase region on chromosome 8p, with a maternal C>G mutation rate that is up to 50-fold greater than the rest of the genome. The age-related accumulation of maternal non-crossover gene conversions also mostly occurs within these regions. Increased sequence diversity and linkage disequilibrium of C>G variants within regions affected by excess maternal mutations indicate that the underlying mutational process has persisted in humans for thousands of years. Moreover, the regional excess of C>G variation in humans is largely shared by chimpanzees, less by gorillas, and is almost absent from orangutans. This demonstrates that sequence diversity in humans results from evolving interactions between age, sex, mutation type, and genomic location.",

    "abstract": "Some cancer therapies damage DNA and cause mutations in both cancerous and healthy cells. Therapy-induced mutations may underlie some of the long-term and late side effects of treatments, such as mental disabilities, organ toxicity and secondary neoplasms. Nevertheless, the burden of mutation contributed by different chemotherapies has not been explored. Here we identify the mutational signatures or footprints of six widely used anticancer therapies across more than 3,500 metastatic tumors originating from different organs. These include previously known and new mutational signatures generated by platinum-based drugs as well as a previously unknown signature of nucleoside metabolic inhibitors. Exploiting these mutational footprints, we estimate the contribution of different treatments to the mutation burden of tumors and their risk of contributing coding and potential driver mutations in the genome. The mutational footprints identified here allow for precise assessment of the mutational risk of different cancer therapies to understand their long-term side effects.",

    "abstract": "There are many possible failure points in the transmission of genetic information that can produce heritable germline mutations. Once a mutation has been passed from parents to offspring for several generations, it can be difficult or impossible to identify its root cause; however, sometimes the nature of the ancestral and derived DNA sequences can provide mechanistic clues about a genetic change that happened hundreds or thousands of generations ago. Here, we review evidence that the sequence context 'spectrum' of germline mutagenesis has been evolving surprisingly rapidly over the history of humans and other species. We go on to discuss possible causal factors that might underlie rapid mutation spectrum evolution.",

    "abstract": "Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) cultured in the presence of LIF occupy a ground state with highly active pluripotency-associated transcriptional and epigenetic circuitry. However, ground state pluripotency in some inbred strain backgrounds is unstable in the absence of ERK1/2 and GSK3 inhibition. Using an unbiased genetic approach, we dissect the basis of this divergent response to extracellular cues by profiling gene expression and chromatin accessibility in 170 genetically heterogeneous mESCs. We map thousands of loci affecting chromatin accessibility and/or transcript abundance, including 10 QTL hotspots where genetic variation at a single locus coordinates the regulation of genes throughout the genome. For one hotspot, we identify a single enhancer variant âˆ¼10 kb upstream of Lifr associated with chromatin accessibility and mediating a cascade of molecular events affecting pluripotency. We validate causation through reciprocal allele swaps, demonstrating the functional consequences of noncoding variation in gene regulatory networks that stabilize pluripotent states inÂ vitro.",

    "abstract": "The challenge of precision medicine is to model complex interactions among DNA variants, phenotypes, development, environments, and treatments. We address this challenge by expanding the BXD family of mice to 140 fully isogenic strains, creating a uniquely powerful model for precision medicine. This family segregates for 6 million common DNA variants-a level that exceeds many human populations. Because each member can be replicated, heritable traits can be mapped with high power and precision. Current BXD phenomes are unsurpassed in coverage and include much omics data and thousands of quantitative traits. BXDs can be extended by a single-generation cross to as many as 19,460 isogenic F1 progeny, and this extended BXD family is an effective platform for testing causal modeling and for predictive validation. BXDs are a unique core resource for the field of experimental precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "As populations boom and bust, the accumulation of genetic diversity is modulated, encoding histories of living populations in present-day variation. Many methods exist to decode these histories, and all must make strong model assumptions. It is typical to assume that mutations accumulate uniformly across the genome at a constant rate that does not vary between closely related populations. However, recent work shows that mutational processes in human and great ape populations vary across genomic regions and evolve over time. This perturbs the mutation spectrum (relative mutation rates in different local nucleotide contexts). Here, we develop theoretical tools in the framework of Kingman's coalescent to accommodate mutation spectrum dynamics. We present mutation spectrum history inference (mushi), a method to perform nonparametric inference of demographic and mutation spectrum histories from allele frequency data. We use mushi to reconstruct trajectories of effective population size and mutation spectrum divergence between human populations, identify mutation signatures and their dynamics in different human populations, and calibrate the timing of a previously reported mutational pulse in the ancestors of Europeans. We show that mutation spectrum histories can be placed in a well-studied theoretical setting and rigorously inferred from genomic variation data, like other features of evolutionary history.",

    "abstract": "The human OGG1 gene encodes a DNA glycosylase activity catalysing the excision of the mutagenic lesion 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine from oxidatively damaged DNA. The OGG1 gene was localized to chromosome 3p25, a region showing frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in lung and kidney tumours. In this study, we have analysed by RT-PCR the expression of OGG1 in 25 small cell lung cancers, in 15 kidney carcinomas and the 15 normal kidney counterparts. The results show that OGG1 messenger RNA can be detected in all tumours tested and that no significant difference was observed in the level of expression between normal and tumoral kidney tissues. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was used to screen this series of human tumours for alterations in the OGG1 cDNA. The study revealed homozygous mutations in three tumours, two from lung and one from kidney. Sequencing analysis of the mutants identified a single base substitution in each of the three cases: two transversions (GC to TA and TA to AT) and one transition (GC to AT). All three substitutions cause an amino acid change in the hOgg1 protein. For the mutant kidney tumour, the normal tissue counterpart shows a wild-type profile. These results suggest a role for OGG1 mutations in the course of the multistage process of carcinogenesis in lung or kidney.",
