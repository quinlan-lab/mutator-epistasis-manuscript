NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves<jats:sup>1</jats:sup>and in the first imaging of a black hole<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.</jats:p>",

MBD4 is responsible for the repair of C&gt;T deamination mutations at CpG locations and has been linked to somatic hypermutation and cancer predisposition in humans. We show here that MBD4-associated hypermutation also affects the germline: the 6 offspring of the<jats:italic>MBD4</jats:italic>-null dam have a 4-6 fold increase in<jats:italic>de novo</jats:italic>mutation burden. This excess burden was predominantly C&gt;T mutations at CpG locations consistent with<jats:italic>MBD4</jats:italic>loss-of-function in the dam. There was also a significant excess of C&gt;T at CpA sites, indicating an important, underappreciated role for MBD4 to repair deamination in CpA contexts. The<jats:italic>MBD4</jats:italic>-null dam developed sustained eosinophilia later in life, but we saw no other signs of neoplastic processes associated with<jats:italic>MBD4</jats:italic>loss-of-function in humans, nor any obvious disease in the hypermutated offspring. This work provides what is likely the first evidence for a genetic factor causing hypermutation in the maternal germline of a mammal, and adds to the very small list of naturally occurring variants known to modulate germline mutation rates in mammals.</jats:p>",

Phenotypic assays of MA lines inform us about the nature of new mutational variation for quantitative traits and provide estimates of the genomic rate and the distribution of effects of new mutations. Parameter estimates compared for a range of species suggest that the genomic mutation rate varies by several orders of magnitude and that the distribution of effects tends to be dominated by large-effect mutations. Some experiments suggest synergistic interactions between the effects of spontaneous deleterious mutations, whereas others do not. There is little reliable information on the distribution of dominance effects of new mutations. Most evidence does not suggest strong dependency of the effects of new mutations on the environment. Information from phenotypic assays has recently been augmented by direct molecular estimates of the mutation rate. </jats:p>",

It is widely recognized that data analyses should ideally be conducted in a reproducible way. Reproducibility enables technical validation and regeneration of results on the original or even new data. However, reproducibility alone is by no means sufficient to deliver an analysis that is of lasting impact (i.e., sustainable) for the field, or even just one research group. We postulate that it is equally important to ensure adaptability and transparency. The former describes the ability to modify the analysis to answer extended or slightly different research questions. The latter describes the ability to understand the analysis in order to judge whether it is not only technically, but methodologically valid.</ns4:p><ns4:p> Here, we analyze the properties needed for a data analysis to become reproducible, adaptable, and transparent. We show how the popular workflow management system Snakemake can be used to guarantee this, and how it enables an ergonomic, combined, unified representation of all steps involved in data analysis, ranging from raw data processing, to quality control and fine-grained, interactive exploration and plotting of final results.</ns4:p>",
